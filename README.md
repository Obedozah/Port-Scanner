## Port Scanner Program ##

This is my version of a port scanner Python program.

This program scans a specific IP address with various options to specify which port the user would like to scan.
    - Commonly scanned ports
    - Manually choose your own ports to scan

## To Use ##

Simply run the main.py script.
Prompts will follow including what IP address you would like to scan and port selection

## Features ##

- Simple I/O with error checking
- Range of ports
- Select own ports or select common protocols (IP)
